              What about safety? Is the Pokémon GO app dangerous to use?
            </p>
            <p>
              "Pokémon GO is designed to be played outdoors. It carries with it some of the risks of any
              outdoor
              activity including hiking, biking, or playing sports in a park. Users should always remain
              aware of their
              environment and avoid going into any inappropriate areas, or any area where they are not
              permitted to be.
              Pedestrians should remain aware of hazards, including other pedestrians, traffic and
              obstacles. As with
              any mobile app, Pokémon GO should not be operated while driving a vehicle. This is
              reinforced by warnings
              and behaviors within the app and it’s vital that people be responsible and not play while
              driving. Parents
              should guide and supervise their children’s use of the product, including where to play and
              how to use a
              mobile phone app safely. To help remind players of the risks and to encourage everyone to
              play safely, the
              Pokémon GO app cautions users about safety and awareness each time it is started."

              Can PokéStops and Gyms be in unsafe areas?
            </p>
            <p>
              "PokéStops and Gyms are created from historical sites, public artwork, and user-designated
              locations. They
              exist in many places, including trails, parks, and urban areas. The safety of any given area
              depends on
              the user, the time of day, and many other factors. We encourage users to use their own
              judgment about
              which parts of the city or countryside they feel safe going to at various times of day or
              night."
